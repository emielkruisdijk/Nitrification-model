# Nitrification-model

## Questions
1. Differential equations for O2 and NO3 are substantially longer than the other equations. Go through these formulas, 
and explain why the O2 and NO3 equations are longer.
2. When would you measure NH4 concentrations over time, keeping in mind the time and money constraints of the experiment? And when for NO2, and NO3?
3. Change the parameter uno to 0. What is happening now? How can we explain the changes occurring in the plot?
4. The system simulated is a closed experiment, where O2 is slowly reduced. Can you change the model so that it simulates an experiment open to the atmosphere (continuous stirred reactor), so that O2 concentrations are constant over time?
